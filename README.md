Things I would do with more time:

-Use React Router to make it appear that you're going to a different page when clicking on different items/so that the back button would work
-Add a catch error for product fetch in case the API wasn't loading
-Add default images to load in case they couldn't be fetched from the API
-Add some custom CSS to fill in rating stars based on average ratings of a product

If there were more products:

-Add filters for product category, average rating, kitchen products, A-Z and price
